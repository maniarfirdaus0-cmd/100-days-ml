📊 Student Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression (Toy ML Project)

This repository contains a toy Machine Learning classification project focused on predicting student placement outcomes using basic academic and aptitude features.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to understand how Logistic Regression works for binary classification problems by applying it to a small, easy-to-interpret dataset.

Input Features:

IQ

CGPA

Output Label:

Placement (Placed / Not Placed)

🧠 Dataset & Approach

The dataset consists of 100 student records.

90 samples are used for training the model.

The remaining 10 samples are used for testing and evaluation.

Logistic Regression is used as the classifier to learn the relationship between IQ, CGPA, and placement status.

📈 Model Performance

Achieved ~90% accuracy on the test data.

A decision boundary is visualized by plotting the data points on a graph, making the classification behavior easy to understand.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

🚀 Key Learnings

Understanding binary classification

Training and testing split

Logistic Regression intuition

Decision boundary visualization
